## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

During this project, I focused on creating a responsive card component that adapts well to different screen sizes. I learned how to effectively use Flexbox for layout and how to implement hover effects using CSS. Hereâ€™s an example of how I styled the button:


```css
button {
    background: var(--dark-cyan);
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    border: none;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 10px;
    color: var(--white);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to explore more complex layouts using CSS Grid and improve my JavaScript skills for dynamic interactions. I also plan to refine my understanding of accessibility best practices to ensure that my components are usable for all users.
